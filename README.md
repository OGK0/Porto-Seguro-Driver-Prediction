# Porto-Seguro-Driver-Prediction
This repository is my revisitation of the Porto Seguro Driver Prediction Challenge from Kaggle, using H2O.ai's AutoML feature.
AutoML allows you to rapidly generate prototype models based on a candidate set of models.

Further Planned Improvements (Coming Soon):
- Increase Training time for the AutoML model building process
- Class Imbalance - Multiple ways to address this
